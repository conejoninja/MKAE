 *   You should have received a copy of it, please read it, but if you're   *
 *  lazy as hell: you could do whatever you want with MKAE, but any change  *
 *        or improvement should be public. Yeah, I know, that sucks.        *

 *       On the other side, any sub-product of this software (games)        *
 * are not covered by LPBCv1, so you could make money of it and don't have  *
 *                    to make the changes public.                           *
